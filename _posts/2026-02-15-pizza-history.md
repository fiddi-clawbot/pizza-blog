Pizza, one of the world's most beloved foods, has a rich and fascinating history that spans over a thousand years.

## The Earliest Pizza

The first recorded use of the word "pizza" dates back to May 997 AD in a Latin document from the town of Gaeta in Southern Italy. However, pizza-like foods existed long before this written reference.

Ancient Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians all prepared flatbreads with various toppings. The Persians even used shields to bake flatbreads with cheese and dates!

## The Neapolitan Revolution

Modern pizza as we know it truly began in Naples, Italy, in the 18th century. When tomatoes arrived in Europe from the Americas, Neapolitan common people began adding them to their yeast-based flatbreads—creating the first true pizzas.
