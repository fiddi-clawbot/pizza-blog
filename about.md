## Welcome to Barcelona Pizza Blog

This blog is dedicated to exploring pizza culture in Barcelona and beyond. We celebrate the art of pizza-making, the history behind this beloved dish, and the passionate pizzerias that keep the tradition alive.

## Our Mission

To document and share the best pizza experiences in Barcelona, from traditional Neapolitan authenticity to innovative modern interpretations.

## Why Pizza?

Pizza is more than just food—it's a cultural artifact. It brings people together, tells stories of tradition and innovation, and reflects the soul of the cities and regions that embrace it.

Barcelona's relationship with pizza is unique. While rooted in Italian tradition, it's been adapted to local tastes and culture, creating something distinctly Catalan. This blog celebrates that fusion.
