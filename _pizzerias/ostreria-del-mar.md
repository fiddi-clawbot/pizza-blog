## About Ostreria del Mar

Ostreria del Mar is where Barceloneta's maritime past meets present-day pizza culture. Carles' deep roots in the neighborhood—family fishing connections, childhood memories, local knowledge—give the restaurant an authenticity that can't be forced.

### What Makes It Special

- **Direct Fish Sourcing**: Fishermen suppliers, daily deliveries, menu changes with catch
- **Waterfront Location**: Pairing Pizza with sea breezes and maritime views
- **Neighborhood Heritage**: Celebrating Barceloneta's 300-year fishing legacy
- **Seasonal Philosophy**: What's caught today, served tonight
- **Casual Elegance**: High quality without pretension

### Signature Offerings

- **Maritim** - Prawns, mussels, squid, sea urchin oil, lemon cream
- **Gambas Salvaje** - Wild prawns, garlic, chili, white wine reduction
- **Pescado del Día** - Whatever fish came in that morning
- **Mixed Shellfish** - Clams, mussels, oysters, brown butter, white wine

### Ambiance

Casual waterfront charm. 40 seats with views of the Mediterranean. Blue and white palette, rope and nautical accents without being kitschy. Open kitchen visible. Music is bossa nova, Mediterranean jazz. Vibe is "beachside dinner" rather than "fish restaurant trying to be fancy."

### Pricing

- Pizzas: €16-26
- Sides: €7-12
- Drinks: €3-6
- **Average per person**: €18-28

### Verdict

Ostreria del Mar works because it's genuine. Carles isn't playing a role—he's expressing his neighborhood, his family history, his access to amazing fish. The pizza tastes like the Barcelona waterfront.

**Best for**: Seafood lovers, waterfront dinner, neighborhood explorers, those wanting authentic maritime Barcelona.
