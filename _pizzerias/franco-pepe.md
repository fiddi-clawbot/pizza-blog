## About Franco Pepe's Pizza

Franco Pepe's Barcelona outpost is not your casual Thursday night pizza dinner. This is a pilgrimage. Located in the quiet, upscale neighborhood of Sarrià, the restaurant embodies a philosophy: seasonal ingredients, impeccable technique, and pizza as a complete culinary statement.

### What Makes It Special

- **Seasonal Mastery**: Menu changes with the harvest. Spring brings asparagus and early greens. Summer: tomatoes and stone fruits. Fall: mushrooms and game. Winter: roots and preserved elements.
- **Ingredient Sourcing**: Collaborations with organic farmers, foragers, and artisanal producers. Every ingredient has a story.
- **Technique**: Dough fermented for 72 hours. Wood oven calibrated daily. Every pizza executed with precision that rivals any Michelin kitchen.
- **Plating Philosophy**: Pizzas are composed like a plate at a fine restaurant—balance, color, texture, surprise.
- **Wine Pairing**: Curated Italian and Spanish wines specifically chosen to complement the pizzas.

### Signature Approach

Rather than traditional signatures, Franco changes his menu with the season. Examples:

- **Spring Stagionale** - Burrata, green garlic, wild asparagus, aged balsamic, crispy guanciale
- **Summer Stagionale** - Peak tomatoes, burrata di bufala, basil, heirloom tomato water, extra virgin olive oil
- **Autumn Stagionale** - Porcini mushrooms, truffle, caramelized onions, taleggio, black garlic
- **Winter Stagionale** - Root vegetables, aged cheese, smoked meats, winter greens, white truffle oil

### Ambiance

Refined elegance without pretension. 40-seat dining room with warm lighting, natural materials, and an open kitchen where Franco's team works with ballet-like precision. The soundtrack is carefully curated—Italian jazz, contemporary classics. Servers are knowledgeable and passionate about the food. This is where pizza meets tasting menu culture.

### Pricing

- Pizzas (seasonal): €22-32
- Appetizers: €12-18
- Sides & vegetables: €8-15
- Desserts (house-made): €8-12
- Wine program: €40-150+ (by the glass/bottle)
- **Average per person**: €45-70 (food + wine)

### Verdict

Franco Pepe is the pinnacle of Barcelona's pizza scene. This is pizza as art, as technique, as philosophy. If you want to understand how far pizza can go—how it can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any cuisine—Franco shows the way. Reservations essential.

**Best for**: Special occasions, food enthusiasts, wine lovers, chefs and culinary professionals, anyone seeking transcendent pizza.
