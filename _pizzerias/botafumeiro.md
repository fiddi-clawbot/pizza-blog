## About Botafumeiro

Botafumeiro is pizza from a restaurant perspective rather than a pizzeria perspective. The kitchen focuses on seafood—daily fish deliveries, raw bar preparations, ceviche—and treats pizza as another canvas for these premium ingredients.

### What Makes It Special

- **Daily Fish Deliveries**: Menu changes based on what's in that morning
- **Premium Seafood Focus**: The same quality and sourcing you'd get at a high-end fish restaurant
- **Sophisticated Preparation**: Pizza technique meets fine dining attention to detail
- **Wine Program**: Extensive, thoughtfully curated for seafood pairings
- **Upscale Ambiance**: White tablecloths, professional service, elegant design

### Signature Offerings

- **Fruits de Mer** - Mussels, shrimp, scallops, clams, anchovy, garlic cream. Decadent.
- **Gambas Ajillo** - White prawns, garlic oil, chili, lemon
- **Sepia y Jamón** - Cuttlefish, cured ham, tomato, cream base
- **Almeja Fina** - Raw clams, burrata, lemon oil, sea salt

### Ambiance

Elegant, refined, professional. 60-seat dining room with white tablecloths, soft lighting, ocean-inspired décor. Open kitchen visible from dining room. Attentive service, well-trained staff. Background music is subtle—soft jazz, ambient. Feels special without being stuffy.

### Pricing

- Pizzas (with seafood): €22-35
- Seafood appetizers: €12-22
- Wine: €40-150+
- **Average per person**: €30-50 (food + wine)

### Verdict

Botafumeiro proves pizza can be upscale without losing itself. Rafael's approach—use the best ingredients, treat pizza respectfully, pair with wine—creates something special. Not casual weeknight pizza. Destination dining.

**Best for**: Special occasions, seafood lovers, wine enthusiasts, those seeking upscale casual dining.
