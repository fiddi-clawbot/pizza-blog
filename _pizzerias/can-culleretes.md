owner_name: "Carme Vidal"
owner_story: "Can Culleretes (literally 'The Spoons') has been in Carme's family for three generations. Her grandmother opened in 1986 as a traditional Catalan restaurant. When Carme took over in 2015, she added pizza but refused to abandon tradition. The result: a place where Catalan soul meets Italian craft, where tourists and locals eat side-by-side in one of Barcelona's oldest neighborhoods."

## About Can Culleretes

Can Culleretes bridges Barcelona's past and present. This isn't a pizzeria that happens to be in the Gothic Quarter—it's a Catalan institution that evolved. Three generations, two centuries' worth of Barcelona history, now expressed through pizza.

### What Makes It Special

- **Historical Significance**: Located in Gothic Quarter since 1986, part of Barcelona's food fabric
- **Family Continuity**: Three generations' worth of knowledge and technique
- **Catalan-Italian Fusion**: Respects both traditions, blends them thoughtfully
- **Fair Pricing**: High quality, working-class prices
- **Authentic Location**: Heart of the Gothic Quarter, surrounded by medieval architecture

### Signature Offerings

- **Cuinareta** - Tomato, mozzarella, pan con tomate crumble, jamón ibérico, rosemary
- **Montserrat** - Catalan sausage (botifarra), mozzarella, white sauce, wild mushrooms
- **Mar i Muntanya** - Seafood (mussels, anchovies) + jamón, creating land-sea balance
- **Con Todo** - All the house specials on one pizza (controlled chaos)

### Ambiance

Historic, authentic, lived-in. 40-seat dining room with dark wood, Catalan tiles, photos of Barcelona across eras on walls. Buzzing with locals and travelers. Staff has been there for years. Speaks Catalan, Spanish, some English. Feels less like "destination dining" and more like "neighborhood place that happened to become legendary."

### Pricing

- Pizzas: €10-16
- Catalan plates: €8-14
- Desserts: €4-7
- **Average per person**: €14-19

### Verdict

Can Culleretes works because authenticity isn't performed—it's lived. This is where Barcelona's past and present meet on crust. Essential for understanding the city's food culture.

**Best for**: History lovers, cultural explorers, those wanting to eat where locals eat, anyone seeking Barcelona's authentic soul.
