owner_story: "Giulio arrived in Barcelona from Milan with €500 and a dream. That was 18 years ago. Latteria started as a tiny counter with no seating. Now it's a beloved neighborhood spot where regulars don't need menus—Giulio knows what they want. His strategy: use fresh ingredients, don't overthink it, treat every pizza like it's for someone you love."

snippet: "Casual Italian done right. Fresh pasta, solid pizza, affordable, beloved by the neighborhood."
