owner_story: "Luca brought Rome's casual pizza culture to Eixample after 10 years running a pinceria (pizza al taglio shop) in Testaccio. He believes good pizza shouldn't require a reservation or a hefty bill. Every morning, dough ferments in the cold proof overnight, and by 10am, the first pizzas come out of the oven."

## About Al Taglio

Al Taglio brings Rome's beloved pizza al taglio culture to Barcelona's busiest neighborhood. Standing at the counter and pointing at slices of pizza you want is considered the height of culinary sophistication in Rome—and Luca has perfected this casual, delicious tradition.

### What Makes It Special

- **Roman Technique**: Thin, oil-rich dough. Baked in electric deck ovens (not wood-fired) for consistency
- **High Hydration Dough**: Extra water creates the signature crispy-yet-tender crumb
- **Variety**: 15-20 different pizzas rotate daily
- **Value**: €4-10 per slice. Perfect for budget travelers and hungry locals alike
- **Speed**: Point, slice, pay, eat. Takes 90 seconds total.

### Signature Offerings

- **Romana Classica** - Tomato sauce, mozzarella, oregano
- **Zucchini & Potato** - Roasted zucchini, potatoes, rosemary
- **Burrata & Cherry Tomato** - Creamy burrata, fresh tomatoes, basil
- **Mortadella & Pistachio** - Cured mortadella, ground pistachio, cream

### Ambiance

Standing-room counter. No seating inside (though you can take away or eat at nearby park benches). High-energy, fast-paced, local crowd. Conversations in Spanish, Italian, Catalan mixing together. This is Barcelona's casual side.

### Pricing

- Slices: €4-7
- Whole pizza: €18-28
- Drinks: €2-4
- **Average per person**: €8-12 (if getting 2-3 slices)

### Verdict

Al Taglio is essential for anyone who wants good pizza without ceremony. Luca's Roman training shows in every crispy, oily slice. This is daily pizza, not special occasion pizza—and it's perfect at that.

**Best for**: Quick lunch, late-night snacking, budget-conscious visitors, pizza lovers who want to eat like Romans.
