## About Pizzeria Beddia

Pizzeria Beddia is one of Barcelona's most celebrated pizzerias, recognized for its unwavering commitment to authentic Neapolitan pizza. Located in the atmospheric Gothic Quarter, this intimate 30-seat restaurant feels more like stepping into a Naples alley than a Barcelona establishment.

### What Makes It Special

- **Wood-Fired Oven**: A traditional brick oven, carefully maintained to reach 900°F for perfect 60-second bakes
- **Ingredient Quality**: Imported San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala flown in weekly, Italian flour aged 72 hours
- **Technique**: Dough fermentation follows Neapolitan standards—48-72 hour cold ferment for optimal flavor
- **Simplicity**: Beddia respects the pizza; nothing is overdone

### Signature Dishes

- **Margherita Classica** - The gold standard. Tomato, mozzarella, basil, olive oil.
- **Carbonara** - Guanciale, pecorino romano, egg yolk. A creamy, savory marvel.
- **Quattro Formaggi** - Fior di latte, mozzarella, pecorino, gorgonzola. Rich and complex.
- **Marinara** - Tomato, garlic, oregano. Purist's choice.

### Ambiance

Exposed brick walls with warm lighting. Open kitchen where you watch pizzaiolos working the oven. Small bar counter seats 6. Background music: Italian classics and modern Mediterranean playlists. Intimate, authentic, never pretentious.

### Pricing

- Pizzas: €12-18
- Sides (burrata, caprese): €6-9
- Drinks: €3-7
- **Average per person**: €25-35 (food + drinks, no alcohol)

### Verdict

Beddia is essential. Maria has nailed the fundamentals that most try and fail at. If you want to understand Neapolitan pizza, sit at the bar, watch the oven, and order the Margherita. You'll understand why Naples obsesses over pizza.

**Best for**: Pizza purists, first-time visitors to Barcelona, anyone who wants to understand pizza fundamentals.
