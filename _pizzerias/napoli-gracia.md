owner_name: "Giuseppe Marino"
owner_story: "Giuseppe spent 15 years running a pizzeria in Naples before moving to Barcelona in 2012. He chose Gràcia deliberately—a neighborhood with soul, where people still know their neighbors. His Napoli is a neighborhood institution, the kind of place where regulars have their own tables and the staff remembers your drink order."

snippet: "Classic Neapolitan in a neighborhood setting. Authentic, unpretentious, beloved by locals."

## About Napoli

In a neighborhood full of trendy fusion spots and Instagram bait, Giuseppe's Napoli stands as a quiet rebellion: a straightforward neighborhood pizzeria that's been doing the same thing well for over a decade.

### What Makes It Special

- **Authentic Neapolitan**: Made in Naples, brought to Barcelona. No modifications for local taste.
- **Neighborhood Soul**: Regular customers, long-term staff, no tourist trap vibe
- **Fair Pricing**: High quality, working-class prices
- **Traditional Method**: Dough fermented 48 hours, wood oven at 900°F, 60-second bake
- **Consistency**: Same recipe, same quality, every single day

### Signature Offerings

- **Margherita Autentica** - The test of a pizzeria. Giuseppe nails it.
- **Cacio e Pepe** - Pecorino, black pepper, creamy and perfect
- **Salsiccia e Friarielli** - Italian sausage, roasted greens
- **Marinara** - Tomato, garlic, oregano. Purist's dream.

### Ambiance

Casual neighborhood spot. Small 25-seat dining room with a few tables outside on the street. Checked tablecloths, wood-fired oven visible, constant hum of regulars and conversation. This is Thursday night pizza, not special occasion pizza. Warm, welcoming, zero pretense.

### Pricing

- Pizzas: €8-13
- Drinks: €2-4
- **Average per person**: €12-18 (food + drink)

### Verdict

Napoli proves you don't need innovation or pretense to run a great pizzeria. Giuseppe's philosophy is simple: buy the best ingredients, use traditional technique, treat customers like neighbors. The result is exactly what Barcelona needs more of.

**Best for**: Neighborhood explorers, locals, anyone who wants authentic Neapolitan without paying premium prices.
