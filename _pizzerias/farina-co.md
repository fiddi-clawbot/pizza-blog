owner_story: "Sofia and Gabriel met at bread-making school in France. Obsessed with fermentation, starter cultures, and dough chemistry, they opened Farina & Co to celebrate the complexity that slow fermentation creates. By day, they run a bakery. By evening, that same dough becomes pizza. Everything comes from the same deep well of technique."

## About Farina & Co

Farina & Co inverts the typical pizzeria model: instead of a pizzeria that maybe has good bread, it's a bakery that makes pizza. Sofia and Gabriel's obsession is fermentation—what happens when you take time, use quality starter cultures, and let chemistry do the work.

### What Makes It Special

- **Sourdough Mastery**: Lievito madre (sourdough starter) maintained for 7 years, used in all doughs
- **Extended Fermentation**: 72-hour cold ferments, sometimes longer
- **Texture Philosophy**: Crust texture and flavor matter more than toppings
- **Daytime Bakery**: Morning pastries, croissants, focaccia—same sourdough culture
- **Seasonal Vegetable Focus**: Works with local farmers for seasonal produce

### Signature Offerings

- **Lievito Madre** - The foundation. Sourdough starter, tomato, mozzarella, basil. Perfectly sour, incredible crust.
- **Olive Oil & Sea Salt** - Focaccia-style, extra virgin olive oil, fleur de sel
- **Roasted Vegetable** - Seasonal vegetables, caramelized, fresh herbs
- **Cheese & Honey** - Assorted cheeses, local honey drizzle, black pepper

### Ambiance

Casual but thoughtful. 25-seat dining room with a visible bakery/kitchen. Shelves lined with fresh bread, pastries, jars of starter culture. Casual wood tables, bakery-cafe vibe. Background music is French jazz and contemporary instrumental. Morning crowds for coffee and pastries; evening crowds for pizza.

### Pricing

- Pizzas: €10-16
- Pastries: €2-5
- Coffee & drinks: €2-4
- **Average per person**: €13-20

### Verdict

Farina & Co is for pizza lovers interested in the technical side. The crust—developed over 72 hours of fermentation—tastes like nothing else. Simple toppings let the dough shine. If you want to understand what time and technique do, eat here.

**Best for**: Bread nerds, fermentation enthusiasts, minimalists, morning-to-evening explorers.
